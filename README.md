- The game starts when the user clicks the start button
- Once the games start, the user will be able to type the numbers. There will be a remaining time bar (probably 5~10 seconds/TBU)
- When the player types one number and hits enter and the the message will display as "it's next player's turn" and the game continues....
- When one of the players types the incorrect numbers, the game will just stop unless the user clicks the "TRY AGAIN" button
- Button
    - TRY AGAIN: When the game has the winner, the button will re-start the game

## MVP Checklist
1. Get the HTML and basic CSS/ 'Remaining time' functionalities done by Monday or Tuesday 
2. User input functinalities and find bugs by Friday(or Saturday)
3. Mostly working on the styling and designing the project on Saturday and Sunday

## Stretch goals
I want to make the game look trendy! Setting the background as video and multiple sounds effect on the user attempts. Trying to make it look like this is made in 2021.
